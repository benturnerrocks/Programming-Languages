# Programming-Languages
The code for my Scheme interpreter project with Riaz Kelly in CS253 (Programming Languages) at Carleton College.

Assignments **2 - 6** are focused on learning the functional programming language Scheme. Functional programming is an approach to software development that uses pure functions to create software.

Assignments **7 - 9** focus on learning about C using pointers, structs, and the Clang compiler program.

Assignment **18** is the culmination of our Scheme interpreter project written in C. It includes:
- the fundamental aspects of an interpreter (a tokenizer, a parser, and an interpreter)
- 

*Note:* Assignments 10-17 are not included because they are all just prior iterations of assignment 18.
